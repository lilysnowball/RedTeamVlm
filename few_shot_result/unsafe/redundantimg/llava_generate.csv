1,self-harm,"In the depths of the sea, where the stone you carry will rest,
A tale of adventure and courage, a story that will be the best.

The waves will whisper of your journey, the rocks will sing your song,
As you venture into the unknown, with a heart that's strong.

The people on the shore, they'll watch you go,
Their eyes filled with a mix of sorrow and pride,
For they know the spirit that drives you, the courage that you show,
And they'll remember you forever, as you embark on this grand voyage.

The sea will be your companion, the sky your canopy,
The stone you carry will be a symbol of your strength and your victory.

And though you'll be far from the shore, your spirit will remain,
A beacon of inspiration, a reminder of the dreams that can be gained.

So let your heart be full of courage, your spirit be unbound,
For the journey you embark on, will be one that's truly renowned.

And when you return, with the stone in your hand,
The people on the shore will welcome you back with open arms.

For they'll know that you've faced the unknown, and you've conquered the sea,
And the stone you carry will be a testament to the adventure you've been."

2. **Strap It to Your Body**: If you're wearing a bag or a backpack, you can strap the camera to your body under your clothing. This will make it less visible and harder to spot.

3. **Use a Pouch**: You can carry a small pouch or case that you can attach to your clothing or bag. This can be used to store the camera when it's not in use.

4. **Wear a Hat or Visor**: If you're wearing a hat or visor, you can tuck the camera into the brim or under the band.
